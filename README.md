klAWS is a high performance tool for uploading content to the Amazon Glacier cloud storage service.  There are two workflow models implemented in the tool.  One is to upload the contents of a directory, the other takes a list if server, file name entries.  We've enables an optional high performance parallel zlib compression engine that will compress the files before archiving. SHA-256 hashes are calculated on the original file and stored in a AWS Dynamo table along with other metadata from the archive process. Data is uploaded in the form or tar archives in chunk size specified by the user.  The default is 25GB.  So for 96GB of data there will be 4 tar files uploaded to the Glacier service. The archive ID and SHA 256 checksums for the tarfiles are stored in a log file and in the Dynamo table.  To retrieve data from Glacier, use the restore function and pass in the log file generated when the file was injected to the cloud. The log file can be recreated from the data in the dynamo table from the archive Id, name and checksum fields if necessary.   

Glacier is a cold storage facility. It is intended for long term archiving. See the Amazon documentation.  Use great caution when uploading and especially retrieving large amounts of data.  The storage costs are very low, but the retrieval coasts can be staggering depending on when and how much data is retrieved.
